## Requirements

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

### Hardware

- 1 x [Raspberry Pi camera module](http://www.raspberrypi.org/product/camera-module/)
- 1 x Set of Quick-Connect Wires (e.g. from [ModMyPi](https://www.modmypi.com/raspberry-pi-hacking/buttons-and-switchs/arcade-button-quick-connect-wires))
- 1 x Tactile button (e.g. from [ModMyPi](http://www.modmypi.com/raspberry-pi/hacking-and-prototyping/buttons-and-switches/colorful-tactile-button-switch-assortment-round-15-pack))

### Software

- Twython for Python 3

See more information on checking you have these packages installed, and how to install them, on the [software installation](software.md) page.

### Extras

- Babbage Bear from the [Swag Store](http://swag.raspberrypi.org/products/babbage-bear)
- Scissors
- Pliers
- Safety pins
- USB WiFi dongle (optional)

## Worksheet & included files

You'll need the worksheet for the instructions and the GPIO diagram for the button setup. Optionally, you can download the final version of the code to save typing it out.

- [The worksheet](worksheet.md)
- [GPIO diagram](images/gpio-diagram.png)
- (Optional) Final version of Python code [babbage.py](code/babbage.py) and [auth.py](code/auth.py)
    - Download to the home directory with:
        
        ```bash
        wget http://goo.gl/ySSbDl -O babbage.py --no-check-certificate
        wget http://goo.gl/msiYoo -O auth.py --no-check-certificate
        ```

## Python 2 compatibility

This worksheet works fine in both Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is recommended but if you require Python 2 for an extension of the worksheet, simply use the equivalent Python 2 packages when installing. See the [software installation](software.md) page.
